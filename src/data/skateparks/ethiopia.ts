    'The skatepark is located at the suburban area of the city, right under the Entoto forest surrounding Addis Abeba. We continued on a work once started by California Skateparks. What was once only a miniramp is now a full skatepark with both challenging and beginners elements. This project was funded from the Czech-UNDP partnership and our peers from the Czech skateboarding community.',
